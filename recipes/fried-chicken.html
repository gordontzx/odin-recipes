        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 to 4 pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp paprika (helps with browning)</li>
            <li>Vegetable or peanut oil for frying (enough to fill a deep skillet or Dutch oven by 1/2 to 1/3)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong> Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl or a resealable plastic bag. Pour the buttermilk over the chicken, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or ideally overnight, to ensure juicy, tender meat.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the coating:</strong> In a large shallow dish or a robust plastic bag, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika. Mix well until all seasonings are evenly distributed.</li>
            <li><strong>Coat the chicken:</strong> Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing the excess to drip off. Place a few pieces at a time into the seasoned flour mixture. Seal the bag (if using) and shake well, or press the flour mixture onto the chicken in a dish, ensuring it is thoroughly coated. Transfer the coated chicken to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and let it rest for 10-15 minutes; this is a crucial step that helps the coating adhere and become crispy.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat the oil:</strong> In a deep-fat fryer, Dutch oven, or large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat enough oil to reach an approximate temperature of 350°F (175°C). Use a kitchen thermometer for accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the chicken:</strong> Carefully add a few pieces of chicken to the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan, as this will drop the oil temperature and result in soggy chicken. Fry in batches.</li>
            <li><strong>Dark meat (drumsticks and thighs):</strong> Fry for about 10-14 minutes, turning every few minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li><strong>White meat (breasts and wings):</strong> Fry for about 6-10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> The chicken is done when the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) on a meat thermometer and the juices run clear.</li>
            <li><strong>Drain and serve:</strong> Remove the fried chicken from the oil using tongs or a slotted spoon and place it on a paper towel-lined plate or wire rack to drain the excess oil. For larger batches, you can keep the finished chicken warm in a 250°F (120°C) oven while you finish frying the rest.</li>
        </ul>
