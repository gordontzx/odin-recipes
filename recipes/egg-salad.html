        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard (Dijon also works)</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped green onion or chives (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Paprika for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boil and Cool Eggs:</strong> Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, immediately remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 10-12 minutes. Transfer eggs to an ice bath to cool completely, then peel and chop.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine the chopped eggs, mayonnaise, and mustard.</li>
            <li><strong>Season and Mix:</strong> Stir in the green onion (or chives), salt, and pepper. Mix gently until combined, mashing some of the yolks for a creamier texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve immediately, or chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Serve on bread, with crackers, or over salad greens.</li>
        </ul>
